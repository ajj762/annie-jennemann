    <img class="graphic" src="images/monarch-map-01.png" alt="A map of North America shows monarch migration patterns. Western monarchs travel from west of the Rocky Mountains to the coast of California to overwinter. Overwintering is a semi-dormant state where monarchs cluster in trees during the winter. Some of the western monarchs may also travel to overwintering sites in Mexico. Eastern monarchs travel from areas in the north east of the Rocky Mountains to overwintering sites in Mexico. After winter, monarchs travel from overwintering sites back to their summer sites in northern parts of the U.S. and Canada." />
    <img class="graphic" src="images/monarchs.png" alt="An infographic of two illustrations of a male monarch butterfly and a female monarch butterfly. Male monarch butterflies, as shown in the illustration, are orange in color and have thin black veins on their wings. They also have pouches on each of the back of their wings. Female monarchs are a darker orange and have thicker black veins on their wings." />

  <img class="graphic" src="images/SB391-01.png" alt="An infographic showing the Missouri state senators who voted yes and who voted no on SB 391, which was passed in 2019. All 23 of the votes in favor of the bill were Republican senators in rural areas in Missouri. Of the 11 who voted no, 10 were Democratic senators from St. Louis and Kansas City areas. One republican, Mike Cierpiot voted no. Senate Bill 391 was passed in Missouri which prevents individual counties from implementing more
stringent regulations on agriculture operations than the state." />

        <p> In August, an editor for the Missourian asked me to create a timeline about the history of Missouri in honor of the state's bicentennial. I was given as much space as I needed in the print edition, which resulted in a double-truck timeline that was almost two full pages. I really enjoyed working on this graphic and getting a chance to use my design skills in such a big space. </p>
