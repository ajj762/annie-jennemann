  <img class="graphic" src="images/mines-02.png" alt="A bubble chart of Boone County showing priority 2 and 3 mines in Boone County. Over $7 million is still needed to reclaim all of the abandoned mines in the county, with a priority 3 mine in Prathersville requiring the most at $2.84 million." />

      <p> I created this map for a <a href="https://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/local/scars-from-coal-mining-remain-in-boone-county-nature-may-be-fixing-the-problem/article_9e6a972c-5db5-11ec-a150-9bb15962eb93.html">story on coal mines in Boone County for the Columbia Missourian. I used RStudio to clean the data and Adobe Illustrator to design the graphic.</a> </p>

          <p> I created this map after completing a data analysis of Missouri wildfire data that came from the Missouri Department of Conservation for an advanced data journalism class in fall 2021. </p>

    <img class="graphic" src="images/census_spread-01.png" alt="A graphic spread showing Boone County 2020 census data. The spread shows an area line chart of Boone County's population over a century where the population in 2020 reached 183,610 people. The spread also shows a bar chart of the top five growing counties in Missouri from 2010 to 2020 where Boone County is the fifth highest growing county, growing 12.89%. The last part of the spread are 8 mini bar charts showing the change in population for people of different races and ethnicities. The data came from the U.S. Census Bureau." />

        <p> Most recently, I worked with the other graphics editor at the Missourian to create this spread about 2020 census data in Boone County. </p>

    <img class="graphic" src="images/Missouritimeline-01.png" alt="A timeline graphic showing the history of Missouri from 1250 to present day." />

        <p> In August, an editor for the Missourian asked me to create a timeline about the history of Missouri in honor of the state's bicentennial. I was given as much space as I needed in the print edition, which resulted in a double-truck timeline that was almost two full pages. I really enjoyed working on this graphic and getting a chance to use my design skills in such a big space. </p>

    <img class="graphic" src="images/marijuana-01.png" alt="A graphic spread of data about medical marijuana and marijuana arrests in Missouri. The spread includes an area line chart showing marijuana possession arrests from 2010 to 2019 broken down by race, a bar chart of possession arrests by age and sex, a heat map of possession arrests per 100,000 people by state, with Wyoming and South Dakota at the highest arrest rate, and an illustration showing the levels of consequences for possessing different amounts of marijuana. The data came from the FBI and the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. " />

        <p> This is a spread about marijuana-related arrests in Missouri that I created for my final project in the information graphics class at MU. It is a full-page and was published in the print edition of the Missourian Jan. 2021.</p>
