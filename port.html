  <div class="about">
    <p>Hello! I am a graduate student at the MU School of Journalism studying data journalism. I am passionate about analyzing data, designing data visualizations and finding innovative ways to tell stories using visuals.</p>
    <b></b>
    <p>Outside of the world of data, I love spending time with my two cats, Bean and Dany, and riding my bike.</p>
    <p>You can reach me at <a href="mailto:ajennemann@mail.missouri.edu">ajennemann@mail.missouri.edu</a> for questions about any of my work.</p>
